Description: Bisulfite-treated RNA non-conversion in a set of samples is
  analysed as follows : each sample's non-conversion distribution is
  identified to a Poisson distribution. P-values adjusted for multiple
  testing are calculated in each sample. Combined non-conversion P-values
  and standard errors are calculated on the intersection of the set of
  samples. For further details, see C Legrand, F Tuorto, M Hartmann, 
  R Liebers, D Jakob, M Helm and F Lyko (2017) <doi:10.1101/gr.210666.116>.
